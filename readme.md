## Installation
Installing clordle is fairly easy, but there are two ways you should install it:

1. If you're going to use clordle as a library in a single directory but not use the command-line globally, your best bet will be to use:

`npm install clordle`

3. If you're installing to mainly use the CLI game, you should install it like this:
`npm install -g clordle`

While you don't need to install the package like this globally, it will improve the load time when `npx clordle` is invoked.

## Usage (CLI)
Currently, there are no command-line options, so to run the game, simply run `npx clordle`.

## Usage (Library)
I am lazy so these shall come later.
